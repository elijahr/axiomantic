# /axi-rules - Dynamic Rule & Customization Management

Manage flexible customization system with user rules, project rules, and rule precedence for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Dynamic Rule Management System

### Rule Hierarchy & Precedence

**Rule Precedence Order (highest to lowest):**
1. **User Rules** - Personal preferences stored locally (not committed)
2. **Project Rules** - Team-wide rules committed to repository
3. **Base Rules** - Default Axiomantic framework rules

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Higher precedence rules override lower precedence rules
- Within same precedence level, most specific rule wins
- Explicit rules override implicit defaults
- Later rules in same file override earlier rules

### Rule Types & Categories

#### 1. User Rules (.axiomantic/user-rules.md)
**Personal preferences stored locally, never committed:**

```markdown
# User Rules (Local Only - Not Committed)

## Personal Preferences
- Code style overrides for personal workflow
- IDE-specific configurations
- Local development environment settings
- Personal shortcuts and aliases
- Individual productivity customizations

## Override Examples
- comment-style: minimal  # Override project verbose comments
- test-runner: pytest-xvs  # Personal test execution preference
- git-commit: conventional  # Personal commit message format
```

#### 2. Project Rules (.axiomantic/project-rules.md)
**Team-wide rules committed to repository:**

```markdown
# Project Rules (Team-Wide - Committed)

## Project Standards
- Language-specific style guides
- Framework-specific patterns
- Performance requirements
- Security standards
- Documentation requirements

## Team Conventions
- Naming conventions specific to this project
- Architecture patterns and constraints
- Testing strategies and coverage requirements
- Deployment and CI/CD standards
```

#### 3. Base Rules (Built-in Framework)
**Default Axiomantic standards from shared/*.md files:**
- Four-Pillar Validation standards
- Core coding standards
- Documentation principles
- Testing guidelines

### Rule Management Commands

#### View Current Rules
```
/axi-rules view [category]
```

**Categories:**
- `all` - Show all active rules with precedence indicators
- `user` - Show only user-specific rules
- `project` - Show only project-specific rules
- `base` - Show only base Axiomantic rules
- `conflicts` - Show rules that are overridden by higher precedence

**Output Format:**
```
üìã Active Rules for [category]:

üî¥ USER OVERRIDE: comment-style = minimal
   (overrides PROJECT: comment-style = detailed)

üü° PROJECT RULE: test-coverage = 95%
   (overrides BASE: test-coverage = 90%)

üü¢ BASE RULE: code-style = follow-language-conventions
   (active - no overrides)
```

/axi-rules add project test-timeout 30s "All tests must complete within 30 seconds"
/axi-rules add project naming-convention snake_case "Use snake_case for all function names"
```

#### Modify Existing Rule
```
/axi-rules modify [scope] [rule-name] [new-value] [reason]
```

**Examples:**
```
/axi-rules modify user test-runner pytest-verbose "Need more detailed test output"
/axi-rules modify project test-coverage 98% "Increasing quality standards"
```

#### Remove Rule
```
/axi-rules remove [scope] [rule-name] [reason]
```

**Examples:**
```
/axi-rules remove user comment-style "Reverting to project standards"
/axi-rules remove project custom-linter "Linter no longer maintained"
```

#### Rule Conflict Analysis
```
/axi-rules conflicts
```

Shows all rule conflicts and their resolution:
```
üîç Rule Conflict Analysis:

CONFLICT: comment-style
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ USER: minimal (ACTIVE - highest precedence)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT: detailed (OVERRIDDEN)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BASE: contextual (OVERRIDDEN)

CONFLICT: test-coverage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT: 95% (ACTIVE - overrides base)

NO CONFLICTS: 47 rules
```

### Rule Validation & Enforcement

#### Rule Consistency Checking
```
/axi-rules validate
```

**Validates:**
- Rule syntax and format correctness
- No circular rule dependencies
- Rule values match expected types/formats
- Required rules are not overridden inappropriately

#### Rule Application Testing
```
/axi-rules test [rule-name] [test-case]
```

**Test rule application:**
```
/axi-rules test comment-style "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }"
# Output: "Rule 'comment-style=minimal' suggests: No comment needed - function is self-explanatory"

/axi-rules test naming-convention "function addTwoNumbers"
# Output: "Rule 'naming-convention=snake_case' violation: Use 'add_two_numbers'"
```

### Integration with Other Commands

#### Rule-Aware Command Execution

All Axiomantic commands automatically apply active rules:

**`/axi-validate`** integration:
```markdown
Applying active rules for validation:
- USER: comment-style = minimal
- PROJECT: test-coverage = 95%
- PROJECT: naming-convention = snake_case

Validation Results:
‚úÖ Comment style: Following minimal comment preference
‚ùå Test coverage: 87% (below project requirement of 95%)
‚úÖ Naming: All functions use snake_case convention
```

**`/axi-feature`** integration:
```markdown
Feature planning with active project rules:
- Architecture pattern: microservices (PROJECT RULE)
- Testing strategy: TDD with 95% coverage (PROJECT RULE)
- Documentation: API docs required (PROJECT RULE)
- Performance: <100ms response time (PROJECT RULE)
```

#### Rule Override Syntax

Temporarily override rules for specific commands:
```
/axi-validate --override comment-style=detailed --override test-coverage=85%
/axi-feature --ignore-rule performance-standards
/axi-compress --override compression-level=aggressive
```

### Rule Discovery & Suggestions

#### Smart Rule Suggestions
```
/axi-rules suggest
```

**Based on codebase analysis:**
```
üí° Suggested Rules Based on Project Analysis:

DETECTED PATTERN:
- 95% of functions use snake_case naming
- SUGGEST: Add project rule 'naming-convention = snake_case'

DETECTED INCONSISTENCY:
- Test files use both pytest and unittest
- SUGGEST: Add project rule 'test-framework = pytest' for consistency

PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITY:
- Database queries average 2.3s response time
- SUGGEST: Add project rule 'db-query-timeout = 1s'
```

/axi-rules template [project-type]
```

**Generate rule templates for common project types:**
```
/axi-rules template web-api
# Generates template with API-specific rules

```
üìä Rule Metrics (Last 30 days):

MOST TRIGGERED RULES:
1. naming-convention: 47 violations fixed
2. test-coverage: 23 violations fixed
3. comment-style: 18 applications

RULE EFFECTIVENESS:
- comment-style=minimal: 23% fewer comment-related reviews
- test-coverage=95%: 0 production bugs related to untested code
- naming-convention: 15% faster code reviews

SUGGESTED OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Consider raising test-coverage to 98% (current success rate: 100%)
- Consider adding performance-benchmark rule (3 recent perf issues)
```

## Success Criteria

Effective rule management should achieve:
- ‚úÖ **Clear Rule Hierarchy** - User > Project > Base precedence
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Resolution** - Automatic handling of rule conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Integration** - Rules automatically applied by all commands
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Easy to add, modify, remove rules
- ‚úÖ **Team Alignment** - Project rules ensure consistent team standards
- ‚úÖ **Personal Productivity** - User rules support individual preferences
- ‚úÖ **Documentation** - Clear rule documentation and rationale
- ‚úÖ **Validation** - Rule consistency and effectiveness tracking

Remember: Rules should enhance productivity and quality, not create bureaucratic overhead. Focus on rules that solve real problems and eliminate inconsistencies in the development process.
