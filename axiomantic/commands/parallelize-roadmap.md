# Parallelize Roadmap

Converts a regular roadmap document into a parallelizable track-based roadmap with comprehensive coordination instructions for multiple AI assistants working simultaneously.

> **üí° Best Results**: This command works best with LLMs that have advanced reasoning capabilities. The analysis requires critical thinking about task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Usage

```
/parallelize-roadmap [input_file] [output_file]
```

**Parameters:**
- `input_file`: Path to existing roadmap file (default: ROADMAP.md)
- `output_file`: Path for parallelized output (default: ROADMAP_PARALLEL.md)

**Example:**
```
/parallelize-roadmap ROADMAP.md ROADMAP.md
/parallelize-roadmap docs/project-plan.md ROADMAP.md
```

## üß† Critical Thinking Instructions for LLM Execution

When executing this command, the LLM should:

1. **Have an internal dialogue about each task**:
   - "Does task B2 REALLY need B1 to complete first?"
   - "What files does B1 modify? What files does B2 modify?"
   - "If they modify different files, they can be parallel"
   - "Even if they're in the same track, are they actually independent?"

2. **Question every stated dependency**:
   - "Is this a true dependency or just organizational grouping?"
   - "Could these tasks run simultaneously if we had multiple developers?"
   - "What would break if we ran these in parallel?"

3. **Think about work unit sizes**:
   - "Is this a 2-hour task or an 8-hour task?"
   - "Should this be broken into smaller pieces?"
   - "Can parts of this task be done in parallel?"

4. **Challenge sequential assumptions**:
   - "Why are B1, B2, B3 listed sequentially?"
   - "Do they share code? Do they share files?"
   - "Could three different developers work on these simultaneously?"

## Implementation Details

The command performs these transformations:

### 1. Header Analysis & Track Creation
- Parses existing roadmap structure
- Identifies independent task groups
- Creates parallel execution tracks (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- **Detects sub-tasks within tracks that can be parallelized**
- **Creates sub-track notation (B1.1, B1.2, B1.3 for parallel sub-tasks)**
- **Identifies "false dependencies" (tasks marked sequential but actually independent)**
- Assigns descriptive track names and priorities

### 2. Dependency Mapping
- Analyzes task dependencies from original roadmap
- **Distinguishes between "hard dependencies" (truly blocking) and "soft dependencies" (nice-to-have ordering)**
- **Creates micro-convergence points within tracks**
- **Identifies parallel work opportunities within single tracks**
- Creates dependency hierarchy diagram
- **Generates parallel execution tiers showing simultaneous work possibilities**
- Establishes convergence points for synchronization
- Validates dependency chains for circular references

### 2.5. Parallel Execution Tier Generation

- **Tier 1: All tasks that can start immediately after prerequisites**
- **Tier 2: Tasks that depend on any Tier 1 completion**
- **Creates visual representation of parallel opportunities**
- **Calculates maximum parallelization factor (how many devs can work simultaneously)**
- **Identifies critical path vs parallel paths**

### 3. Ownership System Integration
- Adds track ownership headers with session ID fields
- **Supports sub-track ownership (multiple owners per main track)**
- **Creates "work unit" size estimates (2-4 hours vs 8+ hours)**
- **Allows partial track claiming (e.g., claim B1 but not B2/B3)**
- Creates track status summary section
- **Shows parallel work availability dashboard**
- Inserts claiming/releasing instructions
- Adds stalled work recovery procedures

### 4. Progress Tracking Enhancement

- Establishes documentation standards

The resulting parallelized roadmap enables multiple AI assistants to work simultaneously on different tracks while maintaining coordination, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring high-quality deliverables.

## üîç Granular Dependency Analysis Algorithm

### Step 1: Initial Task Inventory
- List all tasks found in the roadmap
- Note their stated dependencies
- Record their estimated completion time

### Step 2: Deep Dependency Analysis
For each task pair (A, B), ask:

**File-Level Analysis:**
- What files does Task A modify?
- What files does Task B modify?
- Is there overlap? 
  - No overlap ‚Üí CAN BE PARALLEL ‚úÖ
  - Some overlap ‚Üí Need coordination ü§ù
  - Complete overlap ‚Üí Must be sequential ‚õî

**Code-Level Analysis:**
- What functions/classes does Task A touch?
- What functions/classes does Task B touch?
- Even in same file, do they touch same code?
  - Different functions ‚Üí Possibly parallel with merge coordination
  - Same functions ‚Üí Likely sequential

**Semantic Analysis:**
- What does Task A accomplish?
- What does Task B accomplish?
- Does B's functionality require A's output?
  - No ‚Üí Parallel ‚úÖ
  - Yes ‚Üí Sequential ‚õî
  - Maybe ‚Üí Needs closer analysis

### Step 3: False Dependency Detection

**Common False Dependencies to Look For:**

1. **Organizational Grouping**: 
   - "All normalization operations" doesn't mean LayerNorm needs BatchNorm first
   - Think: "Are these grouped for convenience or true dependency?"

2. **Historical Ordering**:
   - "We always did B1 before B2" doesn't mean B2 needs B1
   - Think: "Is this tradition or requirement?"

3. **Same Category ‚â† Sequential**:
   - "Performance optimizations C1, C2, C3" might all be independent
   - Think: "Can different devs optimize different things simultaneously?"

### Step 4: Execution Tier Creation

**Build Parallel Execution Tiers:**

```python
# Pseudo-algorithm for LLM to follow:
tier_1 = []
tier_2 = []
tier_3 = []

for task in all_tasks:
    if task.dependencies == ['initial_setup'] or task.dependencies == []:
        tier_1.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_2.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1+tier_2 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_3.append(task)

# Within each tier, tasks can run in parallel
```

### Step 5: Sub-Track Generation

For each major track, ask:
1. Can this be split into independent sub-tasks?
2. What's the optimal work unit size (2-4 hours)?
3. How many developers could work on this track simultaneously?

Example reasoning:
- "Track B has 3 operations: LayerNorm, LinearProjection, KVCache"
- "LayerNorm modifies: layer_norm.comp, layer_norm bindings"
- "LinearProjection modifies: linear_projection.comp, linear bindings"
- "KVCache modifies: kv_cache_*.comp, cache bindings"
- "No file overlap ‚Üí All three can be parallel!"
- "Result: B1, B2, B3 can all be claimed by different developers"

## üìö Examples: False vs True Dependencies

### ‚ùå FALSE Dependencies (Can be parallelized):
1. **B1‚ÜíB2‚ÜíB3 (Layer Norm ‚Üí Linear Projection ‚Üí KV Cache)**
   - Why it looks sequential: Listed in order in roadmap
   - Why it's false: Modify completely different files and functions
   - Parallel potential: 3 developers can work simultaneously

2. **All of Track C waiting for all of Track B**
   - Why it looks sequential: "Performance comes after features"
   - Why it's false: Memory pooling can start anytime
   - Parallel potential: C1/C2 can start immediately after Track A

### ‚úÖ TRUE Dependencies (Must be sequential):
1. **Attention needs Matrix Operations**
   - Why it's true: Attention literally calls matrix multiplication
   - Cannot parallelize: Would fail at runtime without matrix ops

2. **Mixed Precision needs at least one working operation**
   - Why it's true: Can't convert precision without operations to convert
   - Partial parallel: Can start after ANY B track, not ALL

## üìä Expected Output Format

The parallelized roadmap should clearly show:

1. **Parallel Opportunity Summary**:
   ```
   Maximum Parallel Developers: 7
   Total Work Units: 15
   Parallel Efficiency: 70% (vs 30% in original sequential plan)
   ```

2. **Execution Tier Visualization**:
   ```
   [TIER 1 - Can Start Now]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B1 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B2 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ All independent!
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B3 (4-5 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C1 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C2 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D1 (5-6 hrs)
   
   [TIER 2 - After Some Tier 1]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C3 (needs any B)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D2 (needs B1+B2)
   ```

3. **Clear Ownership Boundaries**:
   - Each sub-track lists EXACTLY which files it modifies
   - No file appears in multiple parallel tracks
   - Merge coordination points clearly marked
