# Create Feature - Axiomantic Feature Development

Plan and implement a new feature following Axiomantic principles: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Feature Development Framework

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - What exactly needs to be built?
   - Who are the stakeholders and users?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - What are the constraints and assumptions?

2. **Architectural Assessment** 
   - How does this feature fit into the existing codebase?
   - What existing patterns and conventions should be followed?
   - What components need to be created or modified?
   - Are there any architectural impacts or considerations?

3. **Risk Analysis**
   - What could go wrong during implementation?
   - What are the potential breaking changes?
   - How will this affect existing functionality?
   - What are the rollback strategies?

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture
1. **Technical Design**
   - What's the overall approach and architecture?
   - Which design patterns are most appropriate?
   - How will data flow through the system?
   - What are the key interfaces and contracts?

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - What files need to be created or modified?
   - What's the sequence of development steps?
   - How can the feature be developed incrementally?
   - What are the key milestones and checkpoints?

### Phase 3: Implementation Plan
1. **Development Steps**
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - Dependencies between different parts
   - Testable milestones for incremental delivery
   - Integration points with existing code

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing approach and coverage targets
   - Integration testing requirements
   - End-to-end testing scenarios
   - Performance testing considerations

### Phase 4: Four-Pillar Validation
Plan validation against each Axiomantic pillar:

1. **Coding Standards** - Style guide compliance, code quality metrics
2. **Documentation** - API docs, user guides, architecture documentation  
3. **Project Patterns** - Consistency with existing codebase patterns
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage with meaningful assertions

## Critical Assessment Questions

Before starting implementation, address:

- **Is this feature really needed?** Could existing functionality be extended instead?
- **Have we considered all edge cases?** What happens when things go wrong?
- **Is the design scalable?** How will it perform under load?
- **Does it follow existing patterns?** Or does it introduce unnecessary complexity?
- **Can it be tested effectively?** Is the design testable and maintainable?
- **What's the maintenance burden?** How much ongoing effort will this require?

## Professional Dialogue

**Push back constructively** if:
- Requirements are unclear or incomplete
- The proposed approach seems problematic
- There are better alternatives to consider
- The feature introduces unnecessary complexity
- Testing strategy is insufficient

**Your goal**: Deliver a feature that exemplifies Axiomantic principles of precision, elegance, robustness, and wisdom.

## Output Format

1. **Feature Analysis**: Requirements, constraints, and stakeholder needs
2. **Architectural Impact**: How it fits into existing systems
3. **Implementation Roadmap**: Detailed step-by-step plan
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and mitigation strategies
5. **Validation Plan**: How to ensure Axiomantic standards are met

Remember: Better to spend time planning well than to implement poorly and refactor later.
