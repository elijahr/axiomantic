# Documentation Standards

#### Documentation Principles

- Write for your audience
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update docs when code changes
- Use examples to clarify concepts

#### API Documentation

- Document all public interfaces
- Include parameter descriptions and types
- Provide usage examples
- Document error conditions

#### Code Explanations

- Comment complex logic and algorithms
- Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid obvious comments
- Don't write comments about changes I ask you to make. Comment about the code as it exists, not the history of our session.
- Don't write comments unless they will be useful to a developer reading the code for the first time.
- Don't write "changelog" style comments (e.g., "added", "updated", "removed")

#### Communication and Clarity

- Use consistent terminology
- Structure information logically
- Provide context for decisions
- Make documentation searchable
