# Source Code Standards & Architecture

## Development Standards

### Code Standards

#### Style and Quality
- Follow established style guides for your language
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Avoid magic numbers and hardcoded values

#### Performance and Maintainability
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider memory usage and algorithmic complexity
- Write modular, reusable code

#### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- Use language-specific error handling patterns
- Don't suppress errors without good reason
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

#### Language-Specific Patterns
- Use idiomatic constructs for your language
- Leverage language features appropriately
- Follow established conventions
- Use static analysis tools when available

### Architecture Design

#### System Design Principles
- Design for maintainability, extensibility, and scalability
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Plan for failure scenarios and security from the start

#### Component Relationships
- Define clear interfaces between components
- Minimize coupling between modules
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Document component interactions

#### Best Practices
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Consider performance implications
- Plan for monitoring, observability, security, and failure scenarios
- Document architectural decisions
