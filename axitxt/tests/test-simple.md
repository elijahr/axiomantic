### Code Review Guidelines

Follow these essential practices when reviewing code:

- **Read the entire pull request** - Don't just look at individual files, understand the full context of the changes
- **Check for security vulnerabilities** - Look for potential issues like SQL injection, XSS, or insecure data handling
- **Verify test coverage** - Ensure that new features have appropriate unit and integration tests
- **Review documentation** - Make sure that any public APIs or complex logic are properly documented
- **Consider performance implications** - Think about how the changes might affect system performance
- **Validate error handling** - Check that errors are handled gracefully with meaningful messages
- **Ensure consistency** - Verify that the code follows established patterns and naming conventions

Remember: Good code reviews catch bugs early and help maintain code quality over time.
