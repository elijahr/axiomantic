### Conducting Effective Team Meetings

Running productive team meetings requires skill & preparation. Here's how 2 do well:

**B4 the Meeting:**

"What are we trying 2 accomplish?" Shld be first question when planning meeting. W/o clear objectives, meetings become unfocused time-wasters

- 📋 Send agenda in advance - "Here's what we'll cover & why matters 2 u"
- 👥 Choose right participants - "Who needs 2 be here, & who doesn't?"  
- ⏰ Set realistic time boundaries - "We'll start @ 2 PM & finish by 3 PM, no exceptions"
- 📄 Prepare materials ahead of time - "I'll have all docs ready so we can focus on decisions"

**During Meeting:**

"Let's stay focused on objectives." Keep bringing conversation back 2 agenda items

- 💡 Start w/ context - "Here's why we're here & what we need 2 accomplish"  
- 🗣️ Encourage participation - "What do u think about approach, Sarah?"
- ✅ Make decisions explicit - "So we're agreeing 2 move forward w/ Option B, correct?"
- 📝 Capture action items - "John will handle DB updates by Friday"
- ⏱️ Respect schedule - "We have 5 minutes left, so let's wrap up key points"

**After Meeting:**

"What did we accomplish & what happens next?" Send summary w/in 24 hours

Remember: Great meetings feel like progress was made, not time was wasted
