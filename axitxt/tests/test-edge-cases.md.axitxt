### Handling Complex Scenarios in AxiTxt Compression

These edge cases test limits of compression system:

#### Abbreviation Conflicts
- "Config mgmt" vs "Content mgmt" - both cld become same abbreviation
- "Impl details" vs "Import details" - both cld become same abbreviation  
- "Proj req" vs "Perf req" - context must disambiguate

#### Preserve Exact Meaning
- "NEVER do" vs "never do" - capitalization indicates emphasis level
- "You shld always..." vs "You must always..." - modal verbs have different force
- "Mght work" vs "Will work" - certainty levels matter

#### Tech Precision Required
- "B4 impl the feature" vs "B4 impl a feature" - definite vs indefinite articles can be signif
- "User's password" vs "User passwords" - singular vs plural affects meaning
- "Function returns null" vs "Function returns nothing" - tech accuracy required

#### Context Dependencies  
- "We need 2 valid8 this" - "this" refers 2 something specific that must be clear from context
- "See previous section" - references must remain unambiguous
- "As mentioned earlier" - temporal references need context preservation

#### Special Characters & Formatting
- Code examples: `function validateUser(user)` - must preserve exactly
- File paths: `/usr/local/bin/app` - cannot compress  
- URLs: `https://api.example.com/v1/users` - must maintain exactly
- Version numbers: "v2.1.3" vs "version 2.1.3" - format matters
