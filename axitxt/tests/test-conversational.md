### Conducting Effective Team Meetings

Running productive team meetings requires skill and preparation. Here's how to do it well:

**Before the Meeting:**

"What are we trying to accomplish?" This should be your first question when planning any meeting. Without clear objectives, meetings become unfocused time-wasters.

- **Send an agenda in advance** - "Here's what we'll cover and why it matters to you"
- **Choose the right participants** - "Who needs to be here, and who doesn't?"  
- **Set realistic time boundaries** - "We'll start at 2 PM and finish by 3 PM, no exceptions"
- **Prepare materials ahead of time** - "I'll have all the documents ready so we can focus on decisions"

**During the Meeting:**

"Let's stay focused on our objectives." Keep bringing the conversation back to your agenda items.

- **Start with context** - "Here's why we're here and what we need to accomplish"
- **Encourage participation** - "What do you think about this approach, Sarah?"
- **Make decisions explicit** - "So we're agreeing to move forward with Option B, correct?"
- **Capture action items** - "John will handle the database updates by Friday"
- **Respect the schedule** - "We have five minutes left, so let's wrap up the key points"

**After the Meeting:**

"What did we accomplish and what happens next?" Send a summary within 24 hours.

Remember: Great meetings feel like progress was made, not time was wasted.
