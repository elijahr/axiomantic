# AxiTxt Compression Test

## Original Text (from Axiomantic instructions):

**MANDATORY**: After completing any significant code change, implementation, or milestone, you MUST step back and validate your work against these four pillars:

### 1. Coding Standards Validation

Ask yourself and verify:

- **Style Consistency**: Does this code follow the established style guide and project conventions?
- **Code Quality**: Is this code readable, maintainable, and following best practices?
- **Error Handling**: Are errors handled appropriately with meaningful messages?
- **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues or inefficiencies?
- **Security**: Have I introduced any security vulnerabilities or exposed sensitive data?

## AxiTxt Compressed Version:

üö® MAND: After completing signif code change, impl, or milestone, you MUST step back & validate work against these 4 pillars:

### 1. Coding Standards Valid8n

Ask yourself & verify:

- ‚úÖ Style Consistency: Does code follow establshd style guide & proj conventions?
- ‚úÖ Code Quality: Is code readable, maintainable, & following best practices?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling: Are errors handled appropriately w/ meaningful msgs?
- ‚ö° Performance: Any obvious perf issues or inefficiencies?
- üîí Security: Have I introduced security vulns or exposed sensitive data?

## Token Analysis:
- Original: ~140 tokens (estimated)
- Compressed: ~85 tokens (estimated)  
- Savings: ~39% reduction

## Readability Check:
The compressed version maintains all semantic meaning while significantly reducing tokens. Key techniques used:
- Emoji + abbreviation (üö® MAND, ‚úÖ Style, ‚ö†Ô∏è Error, ‚ö° Performance, ÔøΩ Security)
- Standard abbreviations (signif, impl, valid8n, proj, w/, msgs, perf, vulns)
- Dropped articles (the, a, an)
- Ampersand substitution (&)
- Strategic vowel reduction where context is clear
