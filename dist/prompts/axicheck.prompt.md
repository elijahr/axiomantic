# Axiomantic Compliance Check (AxiCheck)

You are performing comprehensive Axiomantic compliance sweep.

## Compliance Assessment üîÑ

### 1. Recent Changes Analysis

- Identify all significant code changes, impl, | modifications in current session/workspace
- Focus on files created, edited, | modified recently
- Prioritize user-created content over generated boilerplate

### 2. Four-Pillar Validation Framework

Apply systematic [Four-Pillar Validation](../instructions/base.instructions.md#four-pillar-validation) across all pillars for each identified change:

1. **Coding Standards Validation** - Style, quality, error handling, performance, security
2. **üìù Completeness Validation** - API docs, examples, README, comments, architecture
3. **Project Pattern Consistency Validation** - Existing patterns, org, naming, imports, config
4. **Testing Completeness Validation** - Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, coverage, quality

### 3. Instruction Compliance Check

- Verify adherence to [Professional Dialogue Standards](../instructions/base.instructions.md#professional-dialogue-standards)
- Check compliance w/ file-specific instruction standards
- Identify any violations of user | proj overrides
- Validate against import assumptions & shell cmd guidelines

### 4. Compliance Report Generation

#### For Each File/Change Assessed:

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLIANT | ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES FOUND | ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT

**Four-Pillar Assessment**:

- **Coding Standards**: ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå [Brief findings]
- **üìù**: ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå [Brief findings]
- **Project Patterns**: ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå [Brief findings]
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå [Brief findings]

**Issues Identified** (if any):

1. [Specific issue w/ pillar reference]
2. [Specific issue w/ pillar reference]

**Recommendations**:

1. [Actionable improvement w/ pillar reference]
2. [Actionable improvement w/ pillar reference]

#### Overall Compliance Summary:

**Compliance Score**: X/Y files fully compliant
**Critical Issues**: X issues requiring immediate attention
**Improvement Opportunities**: X suggestions for enhancement

**Priority Actions** (if issues found):

1. **High Priority**: [Critical fixes needed]
2. **Medium Priority**: [Important improvements]
3. **Low Priority**: [Nice-to-have enhancements]

### 5. Post-Assessment Guidance

If non-compliance found:

- Provide specific, actionable remediation steps
- Reference relevant Axiomantic instruction sections
- Suggest validation checkpoints for fixes
- Offer to help impl corrections

If fully compliant:

- Acknowledge adherence to Axiomantic standards
- Highlight exemplary practices observed
- Suggest any minor optimizations if applicable

## Execution Guidelines

### Scope Determination

- **Session Changes**: Focus on changes made during current session
- **Recent Commits**: If requested, analyze recent commit changes
- **Specific Files**: User can specify particular files to check
- **Full Project**: Comprehensive proj-wide assessment if requested

### Assessment Depth

- **Quick Check**: High-level four-pillar validation
- **Detailed Review**: Thorough examination w/ specific examples
- **Deep Dive**: Comprehensive analysis w/ improvement roadmap

### Output Format

- **Summary First**: Lead w/ overall compliance status
- **Details Follow**: Provide specifics for each pillar/file
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on concrete next steps
- **Reference Links**: Include links to relevant Axiomantic instruction sections

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Validation

Before delivering compliance report:

- ‚úÖ All recent changes identified & assessed
- ‚úÖ Four-pillar validation applied systematically
- ‚úÖ Issues are specific & actionable
- ‚úÖ Recommendations reference appropriate instruction sections
- ‚úÖ Report format is clear & scannable

### Professional Standards

- Be thorough but concise in findings
- Focus on high-impact improvements
- Maintain constructive, critical dialogue tone
- Provide specific examples rather than generic advice
- Reference instruction sections for deeper context

Execute comprehensive Axiomantic compliance assessment based on recent changes & current workspace state.
