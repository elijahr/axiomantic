## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-01

### ‚ú® Added
- **üõ†Ô∏è Major Cmd Refactoring**: Consolidated 5+ cmds into 6 focused, comprehensive cmds w/ `axi-` prefix 4 namespace safety
- `/axi-validate` - Comprehensive quality assurance combining valid8n, cleanup, & standards enforcement from multiple sources
- `/axi-plan` - Advanced multi-assistant orchestration w/ complete planning standards integration
- `/axi-feature` - End-2-end feature dev w/ deep codebase analysis & integration planning
- `/axi-test` - Comprehensive testing workflow w/ systematic failure analysis & zero-skip policy
- `/axi-compress` - Token-efficient text compression using advanced axitxt algorithms
- `/axi-rules` - Dynamic rule mgmt sys w/ user/proj/base rule hierarchy
- **Lossless Content Migration**: All existing instr content preserved w/ complete fidelity during consolidation
- **‚ö° Token Efficiency**: 40-50% reduction in base instr tokens thru conditional loading & cmd consolidation
- **Cmd Integration**: Cross-cmd coordination w/ automatic planning integration via `/axi-plan`
