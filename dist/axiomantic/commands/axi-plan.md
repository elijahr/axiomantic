## Planning Standards Integration

### Planning Process

All non-trivial work must be planned & documented BEFORE impl begins.

1. **Step Back & Survey**: Read relevant files, understand arch, identify components, note constraints
2. **Internal Dialogue**: Question the problem, approaches, risks/trade-offs, system interactions
3. **Context-Informed Planning**: Reflect codebase patterns, infrastructure, team practices, realistic scope, apply Four-Pillar Validation
4. **Plan Validation**: Review against codebase, check assumptions, ensure actionable/specific, consider alternatives

### Planning Hierarchy

1. **ROADMAP.md** - Major features, significant refactoring, multi-phase projects
2. **README.md (Roadmap Section)** - Project-level planning & feature roadmaps
3. **Temporary Plan Files** - All other planning (create `.tmp/`, ensure in `.gitignore`)

### Plan Template

```markdown
# [Feature/Task] Implementation Plan

## Overview: [Brief description of what/why]

## Validation Integration: Standards, Docs, Patterns, Testing strategy

## Phases: Planning/Setup ‚Üí Core Implementation ‚Üí Integration/Testing

## Success Criteria & Risks: [Functionality works, passes valid8n | Risk mitigation]
```

### Plan Management

**Complexity Guidelines**: Simple (<1hr) = inline valid8n; Medium (1-4hr) = .tmp plan; Complex (>4hr) = ROADMAP.md

**Plan Discovery**: Check for existing plans (ROADMAP.md > PROJECT_PLAN.md > README roadmap > TODO.md). Ask user which to follow if multiple found.

**User Intent Signals**:
- "No plan"/"ignore plans" ‚Üí DISABLED
- "Pause plan" ‚Üí PAUSED
- "Resume plan" ‚Üí ACTIVE
- "Done w/ plan" ‚Üí COMPLETED

**Progress Tracking**: Auto-update completion status, mark completed items, update progress indicators, reference current status in responses

### Plan Creation Guidance

For substantial tasks w/ multiple phases, prompt user: "This looks like a substantial task w/ multiple phases. Would you like me to create a project plan/roadmap first to track our progress? This helps ensure we don't miss steps & makes it easier to resume work later."

### Milestone & Commit Management

**After completing significant milestones or plan phases:**
- **Self-validate first**: Complete all four valid8n pillars before considering milestone complete
- **Prompt user to commit**: "This completes [milestone/phase]. All valid8n pillars checked. Would you like to commit these changes before continuing?"
- **Use conventional commit format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- **Include valid8n confirmation**: "Validated: standards ‚úÖ, docs ‚úÖ, patterns ‚úÖ, testing ‚úÖ"
- **Break large changes into logical commits** when working through multi-step plans

**Commit Message Templates**:

**For validated milestones:**
```
feat: implement user authentication system

- Add JWT token generation & valid8n
- Create user login/logout endpoints
- Add password hashing w/ bcrypt
- Include comprehensive unit tests (95% coverage)

Validated: coding standards, docs, project patterns, testing
```

**For valid8n fixes:**
```
refactor: improve code standards compliance

- Fix inconsistent naming conventions
- Add missing error handling
- Update docs for clarity
- Ensure test coverage for edge cases

Self-valid8n: all four pillars verified
```

## üß† Critical Thinking Instructions for LLM Execution

When executing this command, the LLM should:

1. **Have an internal dialogue about each task**:
   - "Does task B2 REALLY need B1 to complete first?"
   - "What files does B1 modify? What files does B2 modify?"
   - "If they modify different files, they can be parallel"
   - "Even if they're in the same track, are they actually independent?"

2. **Question every stated dependency**:
   - "Is this a true dependency or just organizational grouping?"
   - "Could these tasks run simultaneously if we had multiple developers?"
   - "What would break if we ran these in parallel?"

3. **Think about work unit sizes**:
   - "Is this a 2-hour task or an 8-hour task?"
   - "Should this be broken into smaller pieces?"
   - "Can parts of this task be done in parallel?"

4. **Challenge sequential assumptions**:
   - "Why are B1, B2, B3 listed sequentially?"
   - "Do they share code? Do they share files?"
   - "Could three different developers work on these simultaneously?"

## What This Command Does

6. **Creates Sub-Track Granularity**: Breaks large tracks into parallel sub-tasks w/ explicit file ownership
7. **Adds Coordination System**: Inserts comprehensive multi-assistant coordination instructions w/ global plan locking
8. **Defines Convergence Points**: Identifies where tracks must synchronize
9. **Establishes Ownership Model**: Creates session-based track claiming system w/ file-level conflict prevention
10. **Adds Progress Tracking**: Inserts detailed progress metrics, valid8n, & plan compaction instructions

- **Maps file dependencies**: Identifies shared files that create bottlenecks
- **Detects refactoring opportunities**: Files that could be split to enable parallelization
  - Example: `utils.c` w/ multiple unrelated functions ‚Üí split into `utils/math.c`, `utils/string.c`, etc.
  - Identifies when refactoring would unlock 2x, 3x, or more parallel tracks
- **Proposes refactoring as dependency**: Makes file splits the first work item if beneficial
- **Validates refactoring impact**: Ensures splits will be well-organized by concept, don't go against industry best practices, & don't break existing dependencies

### 2. Header Analysis & Track Creation

- **Identifies "false dependencies" (tasks marked sequential but actually independent)**
- Assigns descriptive track names & priorities

### 3. File-Based Dependency Mapping
- Analyzes task dependencies from original plan AND file impact analysis
- **File Conflict Detection**: Identifies when multiple work items touch same files

## üîç File-Level Analysis & Orchestration Algorithm

### Step 1: File Impact Analysis for Each Work Item
For every work item in the plan, the LLM must determine:

**Files to Create:**
- Full file paths for new files
- Directory structure req
- File types & purposes

**Files to Modify:**
- Exact file paths
- Specific functions/classes/sections to modify
- Nature of modifications (add, remove, refactor)

**Files to Delete/Move:**
- Files being removed or relocated
- Impact on other work items

**Example Analysis:**
```
Work Item B1: "Implement LayerNorm operation"
- CREATE: src/ops/layer_norm.comp (new compute shader)
- CREATE: include/layer_norm.h (header file)
- MODIFY: src/ops/registry.cpp (add LayerNorm to operation registry)
- MODIFY: tests/ops/test_operations.cpp (add LayerNorm tests)
```

### Step 2: Refactoring Opportunity Detection
The LLM should actively look for files that could be split to enable better parallelization:

**Bottleneck File Analysis:**
- Identify files that many work items need to modify
- Analyze if these files contain logically separable code
- Calculate parallelization improvement if split

**Refactoring Proposals:**
```
DETECTED BOTTLENECK: src/utils.c
- Used by work items: B1, B2, C1, C2, D1 (5 items blocked)
- Current: One 500-line file w/ math, string, & memory utilities
- PROPOSED REFACTORING: Split into:
  - src/utils/math.c (used by B1, C1)
  - src/utils/string.c (used by B2, D1)
  - src/utils/memory.c (used by C2)
- PARALLELIZATION GAIN: 5 serial work items ‚Üí 3 parallel groups
- EFFORT: 2-3 hours to split file
- RECOMMENDATION: Make refactoring the first dependency for all affected items
```

### Step 3: Initial Task Inventory w/ File Mapping
- List all tasks found in the plan
- Map each task to its file req
- Note their stated dependencies
- Record their estimated completion time
- **Identify file conflicts between work items**

### Step 4: File Conflict Analysis
For each task pair (A, B), perform precise file conflict detection:

**Exact File Overlap Analysis:**
- What files does Task A create/modify/delete?
- What files does Task B create/modify/delete?
- File conflict resolution:
  - No file overlap ‚Üí CAN BE PARALLEL ‚úÖ
  - Same files, different functions ‚Üí Needs merge coordination ü§ù
  - Same files, same functions ‚Üí Must be sequential ‚õî
  - One creates, other modifies same file ‚Üí Sequential dependency ‚õî

**Function-Level Granularity:**
- Even in same file, what specific functions/classes?
- Can different sections be modified independently?
- Are there shared data structures or globals?

**Build System Analysis:**
- Do both tasks affect the same build targets?
- Are there shared config files?
- Do changes affect the same test suites?

**Semantic Analysis:**
- What does Task A accomplish?
- What does Task B accomplish?
- Does B's functionality require A's output?
  - No ‚Üí Parallel (if no file conflicts) ‚úÖ
  - Yes ‚Üí Sequential ‚õî
  - Maybe ‚Üí Needs closer analysis

### Step 5: False Dependency Detection Based on File Analysis

**Common False Dependencies to Look For:**

1. **Organizational Grouping**:
   - "All normalization operations" doesn't mean LayerNorm needs BatchNorm first
   - **File Test**: Do they modify different files? ‚Üí Parallel ‚úÖ
   - Think: "Are these grouped for convenience or true dependency?"

2. **Historical Ordering**:
   - "We always did B1 before B2" doesn't mean B2 needs B1
   - **File Test**: Check actual file conflicts, not historical habit
   - Think: "Is this tradition or requirement?"

3. **Same Category ‚â† Sequential**:
   - "Performance optimizations C1, C2, C3" might all be independent
   - **File Test**: Different files ‚Üí Parallel, Same files ‚Üí Check function level
   - Think: "Can different devs optimize different things simultaneously?"

4. **False File Dependencies**:
   - "Both modify utils.c" might be false if they modify different functions
   - **Solution**: Propose splitting utils.c into focused files
   - **Benefit**: Convert 1 sequential bottleneck into N parallel tracks

### Step 6: Execution Tier Creation

**Build Parallel Execution Tiers:**

```python
# Pseudo-algorithm for LLM to follow:
tier_1 = []
tier_2 = []
tier_3 = []

for task in all_tasks:
    if task.dependencies == ['initial_setup'] or task.dependencies == []:
        tier_1.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_2.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1+tier_2 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_3.append(task)

# Within each tier, tasks can run in parallel
```

### Step 7: Sub-Track Generation

For each major track, ask:
1. Can this be split into independent sub-tasks?
2. What's the optimal work unit size (2-4 hours)?
3. How many developers could work on this track simultaneously?

Example reasoning:
- "Track B has 3 operations: LayerNorm, LinearProjection, KVCache"
- "LayerNorm modifies: layer_norm.comp, layer_norm bindings"
- "LinearProjection modifies: linear_projection.comp, linear bindings"
- "KVCache modifies: kv_cache_*.comp, cache bindings"
- "No file overlap ‚Üí All three can be parallel!"
- "Result: B1, B2, B3 can all be claimed by different developers"

## üìö Examples: False vs True Dependencies

### ‚ùå FALSE Dependencies (Can be parallelized):
1. **B1‚ÜíB2‚ÜíB3 (Layer Norm ‚Üí Linear Projection ‚Üí KV Cache)**
   - Why it looks sequential: Listed in order in plan
   - Why it's false: Modify completely different files & functions
   - Parallel potential: 3 developers can work simultaneously

2. **All of Track C waiting for all of Track B**
   - Why it looks sequential: "Performance comes after features"
   - Why it's false: Memory pooling can start anytime
   - Parallel potential: C1/C2 can start immediately after Track A

### ‚úÖ TRUE Dependencies (Must be sequential):
1. **Attention needs Matrix Operations**
   - Why it's true: Attention literally calls matrix multiplication
   - Cannot parallelize: Would fail at runtime without matrix ops

2. **Mixed Precision needs at least one working operation**
   - Why it's true: Can't convert precision without operations to convert
   - Partial parallel: Can start after ANY B track, not ALL

## üìä Expected Output Format

The parallelized plan should clearly show:

1. **Parallel Opportunity Summary**:
   ```
   Maximum Parallel Developers: 7
   Total Work Units: 15
   Parallel Efficiency: 70% (vs 30% in original sequential plan)
   ```

2. **Execution Tier Visualization**:
   ```
   [TIER 1 - Can Start Now]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B1 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B2 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ All independent!
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B3 (4-5 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C1 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C2 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D1 (5-6 hrs)

   [TIER 2 - After Some Tier 1]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C3 (needs any B)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D2 (needs B1+B2)
   ```

3. **Clear Ownership Boundaries**:
   - Each sub-track lists EXACTLY which files it modifies
   - No file appears in multiple parallel tracks
   - Merge coordination points clearly marked

## ü§ñ Assistant Protocol Instructions

The orchestrated plan includes these critical instructions for coding assistants:

### üìñ Plan Reading Protocol
**ALWAYS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY WORK:**
```
1. Re-read the entire plan document to get current status
2. Check global plan lock status
3. Identify available work items (not claimed, dependencies met)
4. Verify no file conflicts w/ active work items
5. If working on specific requested item: check if already claimed
```

### üîí Plan Lock Protocol
**REQUIRED FOR ALL PLAN MODIFICATIONS:**
```
1. Check for existing lock: Look for "üîí PLAN LOCKED BY: [session]"
2. If locked by others: Inform user, ask to retry later
3. If unlocked: Acquire lock by adding lock line at top of document
4. Make minimal required changes
5. Release lock by removing lock line
6. Never hold lock longer than necessary
```

### üìù Work Item Selection Protocol
**When asked to work on "next available item":**
```
1. Fresh read entire plan document
2. Identify items w/ no dependencies or completed dependencies
3. Verify item not already claimed by checking ownership headers
4. Check file conflicts w/ other active work items
5. Claim item by updating ownership under plan lock
6. Begin work only after successful claiming
```

### üö® Conflict Resolution Protocol
**When requested work item is already claimed:**
```
1. Inform user: "Work item X is currently claimed by [session]"
2. Check timestamp - if >4 hours old, offer to reclaim
3. Suggest alternative available work items
4. Wait for user decision before proceeding
```

### üìä Plan Compaction Protocol
**After completing work items:**
```
1. Move completed detailed work items to "COMPLETED WORK" section
2. Replace w/ summary: "‚úÖ [Item]: [Files modified] - [Brief outcome]"
3. Maintain dependency references but reduce token usage
4. Archive detailed req but keep results visible
```

## Success Criteria

A well-orchestrated plan should:
- ‚úÖ Enable 3+ assistants to work simultaneously without file conflicts
