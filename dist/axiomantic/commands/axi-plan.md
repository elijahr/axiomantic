## Planning Standards Integration

### Planning Process

All non-trivial work must be planned & documented B4 implementation begins.

1. **Step Back & Survey**: Read relevant files, understand architecture, identify components, note constraints
2. **Internal Dialogue**: Question problem, approaches, risks/trade-offs, system interactions
3. **Context-Informed Planning**: Reflect codebase patterns, infrastructure, team practices, realistic scope, apply Four-Pillar Validation
4. **Plan Validation**: Review vs codebase, check assumptions, ensure actionable/specific, consider alternatives

### Planning Hierarchy

1. **ROADMAP.md** - Major features, significant refactoring, multi-phase projects
2. **README.md (Roadmap Section)** - Project-level planning & feature roadmaps
3. **Temporary Plan Files** - All other planning (create `.tmp/`, ensure in `.gitignore`)

### Plan Template

```markdown
# [Feature/Task] Implementation Plan

## Overview: [Brief desc of what/why]

## Validation Integration: Standards, Docs, Patterns, Testing strategy

## Phases: Planning/Setup ‚Üí Core Implementation ‚Üí Integration/Testing

## Success Criteria & Risks: [Functionality works, passes validation | Risk mitigation]
```

### Plan Management

**Complexity Guidelines**: Simple (<1hr) = inline validation; Medium (1-4hr) = .tmp plan; Complex (>4hr) = ROADMAP.md

**Plan Discovery**: Check 4 existing plans (ROADMAP.md > PROJECT_PLAN.md > README roadmap > TODO.md). Ask user which 2 follow if multiple found.

**User Intent Signals**:
- "No plan"/"ignore plans" ‚Üí DISABLED
- "Pause plan" ‚Üí PAUSED
- "Resume plan" ‚Üí ACTIVE
- "Done w/ plan" ‚Üí COMPLETED

**Progress Tracking**: Auto-update completion status, mark completed items, update progress indicators, reference current status in responses

### Plan Creation Guidance

4 substantial tasks w/ multiple phases, prompt user: "This looks like substantial task w/ multiple phases. Would u like me 2 create project plan/roadmap first 2 track our progress? This helps ensure we don't miss steps & makes it easier 2 resume work later."

### Milestone & Commit Management

**After completing significant milestones or plan phases:**
- **Self-validate first**: Complete all 4 validation pillars B4 considering milestone complete
- **Prompt user 2 commit**: "This completes [milestone/phase]. All validation pillars checked. Would u like 2 commit these changes B4 continuing?"
- **Use conventional commit format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- **Include validation confirmation**: "Validated: standards ‚úÖ, docs ‚úÖ, patterns ‚úÖ, testing ‚úÖ"
- **Break large changes into logical commits** when working thru multi-step plans

**Commit Message Templates**:

**4 validated milestones:**
```
feat: implement user auth system

- Add JWT token generation & validation
- Create user login/logout endpoints
- Add password hashing w/ bcrypt
- Include comprehensive unit tests (95% coverage)

Validated: coding standards, docs, project patterns, testing
```

**4 validation fixes:**
```
refactor: improve code standards compliance

- Fix inconsistent naming conventions
- Add missing error handling
- Update documentation for clarity
- Ensure test coverage for edge cases

Self-validation: all four pillars verified
```

## üß† Critical Thinking Instructions 4 LLM Execution

When executing this command, LLM should:

1. **Have internal dialogue abt each task**:
   - "Does task B2 REALLY need B1 2 complete first?"
   - "What files does B1 modify? What files does B2 modify?"
   - "If they modify different files, they can be parallel"
   - "Even if they're in same track, are they actually independent?"

2. **Question every stated dependency**:
   - "Is this true dependency or just organizational grouping?"
   - "Could these tasks run simultaneously if we had multiple developers?"
   - "What would break if we ran these in parallel?"

3. **Think abt work unit sizes**:
   - "Is this 2-hour task or 8-hour task?"
   - "Should this be broken into smaller pieces?"
   - "Can parts of this task be done in parallel?"

4. **Challenge sequential assumptions**:
   - "Why are B1, B2, B3 listed sequentially?"
   - "Do they share code? Do they share files?"
   - "Could three different developers work on these simultaneously?"

## What This Command Does

1. **Performs File-Level Impact Analysis**: Maps each work item to specific files that will be created, modified, or deleted
2. **Analyzes Dependencies**: Identifies task dependencies and creates dependency chains based on file conflicts

4. **Creates Parallel Tracks**: Groups independent tasks into parallel execution tracks with no file conflicts
5. **Detects False Dependencies**: Identifies tasks marked sequential but actually independent (different files)
6. **Creates Sub-Track Granularity**: Breaks large tracks into parallel sub-tasks with explicit file ownership
7. **Adds Coordination System**: Inserts comprehensive multi-assistant coordination instructions with global plan locking
8. **Defines Convergence Points**: Identifies where tracks must synchronize
9. **Establishes Ownership Model**: Creates session-based track claiming system with file-level conflict prevention
10. **Adds Progress Tracking**: Inserts detailed progress metrics, validation, and plan compaction instructions

## Implementation Details

The command performs these transformations:

### 1. File Impact Analysis & Refactoring Detection
- **Analyzes each work item's file requirements**: Creates/modifies/deletes which files
- **Maps file dependencies**: Identifies shared files that create bottlenecks
- **Detects refactoring opportunities**: Files that could be split to enable parallelization
  - Example: `utils.c` with multiple unrelated functions ‚Üí split into `utils/math.c`, `utils/string.c`, etc.
  - Identifies when refactoring would unlock 2x, 3x, or more parallel tracks
- **Proposes refactoring as dependency**: Makes file splits the first work item if beneficial
- **Validates refactoring impact**: Ensures splits will be well-organized by concept, don't go against industry best practices, and don't break existing dependencies

### 2. Header Analysis & Track Creation
- Parses existing plan structure
- Identifies independent task groups based on file analysis
- Creates parallel execution tracks (A, B, C, D, etc.) with zero file conflicts
- **Detects sub-tasks within tracks that can be parallelized**
- **Creates sub-track notation (B1.1, B1.2, B1.3 for parallel sub-tasks)**
- **Identifies "false dependencies" (tasks marked sequential but actually independent)**
- Assigns descriptive track names and priorities

### 3. File-Based Dependency Mapping
- Analyzes task dependencies from original plan AND file impact analysis
- **File Conflict Detection**: Identifies when multiple work items touch same files
- **Distinguishes between "hard dependencies" (file conflicts) and "soft dependencies" (nice-to-have ordering)**
- **Creates micro-convergence points within tracks**
- **Identifies parallel work opportunities within single tracks**
- Creates dependency hierarchy diagram based on actual file conflicts
- **Generates parallel execution tiers showing simultaneous work possibilities**
- Establishes convergence points for synchronization
- Validates dependency chains for circular references

### 4. Parallel Execution Tier Generation
- **Groups truly independent tasks into execution tiers**
- **Tier 1: All tasks that can start immediately after prerequisites**
- **Tier 2: Tasks that depend on any Tier 1 completion**
- **Creates visual representation of parallel opportunities**
- **Calculates maximum parallelization factor (how many devs can work simultaneously)**
- **Identifies critical path vs parallel paths**

### 5. Global Plan Lock & Ownership System Integration
- **Adds global plan lock mechanism for all plan document updates**
- **Requires fresh plan reading before any work or claiming**
- Adds track ownership headers with session ID fields and file lists
- **Supports sub-track ownership (multiple owners per main track)**
- **Creates "work unit" size estimates (2-4 hours vs 8+ hours)**
- **Allows partial track claiming (e.g., claim B1 but not B2/B3)**
- Creates track status summary section with file ownership matrix
- **Shows parallel work availability dashboard**
- Inserts claiming/releasing instructions with lock protocol
- Adds stalled work recovery procedures

### 6. Progress Tracking & Plan Structure Enhancement
- **Preserves ALL original work item details for active and future work items**
- Adds parallel execution metadata to work items (track assignments, file lists, dependencies)
- Adds quantitative progress metrics alongside original content
- Inserts validation test references without removing original requirements
- Creates milestone definitions with success criteria while keeping all original planning details
- **CRITICAL: Maintains 100% of original conceptual detail for all incomplete work**

### 8. Quality Assurance Framework
- Inserts code quality requirements
- Adds test coverage mandates
- Creates performance benchmark requirements
- Establishes documentation standards
- **File-Level Validation**: Ensures all claimed files are actually modified as planned

The resulting parallelized plan enables multiple AI assistants to work simultaneously on different tracks while maintaining coordination, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring high-quality deliverables.

## üîç File-Level Analysis & Orchestration Algorithm

### Step 1: File Impact Analysis for Each Work Item
For every work item in the plan, the LLM must determine:

**Files to Create:**
- Full file paths for new files
- Directory structure requirements
- File types and purposes

**Files to Modify:**
- Exact file paths
- Specific functions/classes/sections to modify
- Nature of modifications (add, remove, refactor)

**Files to Delete/Move:**
- Files being removed or relocated
- Impact on other work items

**Example Analysis:**
```
Work Item B1: "Implement LayerNorm operation"
- CREATE: src/ops/layer_norm.comp (new compute shader)
- CREATE: include/layer_norm.h (header file)
- MODIFY: src/ops/registry.cpp (add LayerNorm to operation registry)
- MODIFY: tests/ops/test_operations.cpp (add LayerNorm tests)
```

### Step 2: Refactoring Opportunity Detection
The LLM should actively look for files that could be split to enable better parallelization:

**Bottleneck File Analysis:**
- Identify files that many work items need to modify
- Analyze if these files contain logically separable code
- Calculate parallelization improvement if split

**Refactoring Proposals:**
```
DETECTED BOTTLENECK: src/utils.c
- Used by work items: B1, B2, C1, C2, D1 (5 items blocked)
- Current: One 500-line file with math, string, and memory utilities
- PROPOSED REFACTORING: Split into:
  - src/utils/math.c (used by B1, C1)
  - src/utils/string.c (used by B2, D1)
  - src/utils/memory.c (used by C2)
- PARALLELIZATION GAIN: 5 serial work items ‚Üí 3 parallel groups
- EFFORT: 2-3 hours to split file
- RECOMMENDATION: Make refactoring the first dependency for all affected items
```

### Step 3: Initial Task Inventory with File Mapping
- List all tasks found in the plan
- Map each task to its file requirements
- Note their stated dependencies
- Record their estimated completion time
- **Identify file conflicts between work items**

### Step 4: File Conflict Analysis
For each task pair (A, B), perform precise file conflict detection:

**Exact File Overlap Analysis:**
- What files does Task A create/modify/delete?
- What files does Task B create/modify/delete?
- File conflict resolution:
  - No file overlap ‚Üí CAN BE PARALLEL ‚úÖ
  - Same files, different functions ‚Üí Needs merge coordination ü§ù
  - Same files, same functions ‚Üí Must be sequential ‚õî
  - One creates, other modifies same file ‚Üí Sequential dependency ‚õî

**Function-Level Granularity:**
- Even in same file, what specific functions/classes?
- Can different sections be modified independently?
- Are there shared data structures or globals?

**Build System Analysis:**
- Do both tasks affect the same build targets?
- Are there shared configuration files?
- Do changes affect the same test suites?

**Semantic Analysis:**
- What does Task A accomplish?
- What does Task B accomplish?
- Does B's functionality require A's output?
  - No ‚Üí Parallel (if no file conflicts) ‚úÖ
  - Yes ‚Üí Sequential ‚õî
  - Maybe ‚Üí Needs closer analysis

### Step 5: False Dependency Detection Based on File Analysis

**Common False Dependencies to Look For:**

1. **Organizational Grouping**:
   - "All normalization operations" doesn't mean LayerNorm needs BatchNorm first
   - **File Test**: Do they modify different files? ‚Üí Parallel ‚úÖ
   - Think: "Are these grouped for convenience or true dependency?"

2. **Historical Ordering**:
   - "We always did B1 before B2" doesn't mean B2 needs B1
   - **File Test**: Check actual file conflicts, not historical habit
   - Think: "Is this tradition or requirement?"

3. **Same Category ‚â† Sequential**:
   - "Performance optimizations C1, C2, C3" might all be independent
   - **File Test**: Different files ‚Üí Parallel, Same files ‚Üí Check function level
   - Think: "Can different devs optimize different things simultaneously?"

4. **False File Dependencies**:
   - "Both modify utils.c" might be false if they modify different functions
   - **Solution**: Propose splitting utils.c into focused files
   - **Benefit**: Convert 1 sequential bottleneck into N parallel tracks

### Step 6: Execution Tier Creation

**Build Parallel Execution Tiers:**

```python
# Pseudo-algorithm for LLM to follow:
tier_1 = []
tier_2 = []
tier_3 = []

for task in all_tasks:
    if task.dependencies == ['initial_setup'] or task.dependencies == []:
        tier_1.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_2.append(task)
    elif all(dep in tier_1+tier_2 for dep in task.dependencies):
        tier_3.append(task)

# Within each tier, tasks can run in parallel
```

### Step 7: Sub-Track Generation

For each major track, ask:
1. Can this be split into independent sub-tasks?
2. What's the optimal work unit size (2-4 hours)?
3. How many developers could work on this track simultaneously?

Example reasoning:
- "Track B has 3 operations: LayerNorm, LinearProjection, KVCache"
- "LayerNorm modifies: layer_norm.comp, layer_norm bindings"
- "LinearProjection modifies: linear_projection.comp, linear bindings"
- "KVCache modifies: kv_cache_*.comp, cache bindings"
- "No file overlap ‚Üí All three can be parallel!"
- "Result: B1, B2, B3 can all be claimed by different developers"

## üìö Examples: False vs True Dependencies

### ‚ùå FALSE Dependencies (Can be parallelized):
1. **B1‚ÜíB2‚ÜíB3 (Layer Norm ‚Üí Linear Projection ‚Üí KV Cache)**
   - Why it looks sequential: Listed in order in plan
   - Why it's false: Modify completely different files and functions
   - Parallel potential: 3 developers can work simultaneously

2. **All of Track C waiting for all of Track B**
   - Why it looks sequential: "Performance comes after features"
   - Why it's false: Memory pooling can start anytime
   - Parallel potential: C1/C2 can start immediately after Track A

### ‚úÖ TRUE Dependencies (Must be sequential):
1. **Attention needs Matrix Operations**
   - Why it's true: Attention literally calls matrix multiplication
   - Cannot parallelize: Would fail at runtime without matrix ops

2. **Mixed Precision needs at least one working operation**
   - Why it's true: Can't convert precision without operations to convert
   - Partial parallel: Can start after ANY B track, not ALL

## üìä Expected Output Format

The parallelized plan should clearly show:

1. **Parallel Opportunity Summary**:
   ```
   Maximum Parallel Developers: 7
   Total Work Units: 15
   Parallel Efficiency: 70% (vs 30% in original sequential plan)
   ```

2. **Execution Tier Visualization**:
   ```
   [TIER 1 - Can Start Now]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B1 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B2 (3-4 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ All independent!
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B3 (4-5 hrs) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C1 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C2 (2-3 hrs)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D1 (5-6 hrs)

   [TIER 2 - After Some Tier 1]
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ C3 (needs any B)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D2 (needs B1+B2)
   ```

3. **Clear Ownership Boundaries**:
   - Each sub-track lists EXACTLY which files it modifies
   - No file appears in multiple parallel tracks
   - Merge coordination points clearly marked

## ü§ñ Assistant Protocol Instructions

The orchestrated plan includes these critical instructions for coding assistants:

### üìñ Plan Reading Protocol
**ALWAYS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY WORK:**
```
1. Re-read the entire plan document to get current status
2. Check global plan lock status
3. Identify available work items (not claimed, dependencies met)
4. Verify no file conflicts with active work items
5. If working on specific requested item: check if already claimed
```

### üîí Plan Lock Protocol
**REQUIRED FOR ALL PLAN MODIFICATIONS:**
```
1. Check for existing lock: Look for "üîí PLAN LOCKED BY: [session]"
2. If locked by others: Inform user, ask to retry later
3. If unlocked: Acquire lock by adding lock line at top of document
4. Make minimal required changes
5. Release lock by removing lock line
6. Never hold lock longer than necessary
```

### üìù Work Item Selection Protocol
**When asked to work on "next available item":**
```
1. Fresh read entire plan document
2. Identify items with no dependencies or completed dependencies
3. Verify item not already claimed by checking ownership headers
4. Check file conflicts with other active work items
5. Claim item by updating ownership under plan lock
6. Begin work only after successful claiming
```

### üö® Conflict Resolution Protocol
**When requested work item is already claimed:**
```
1. Inform user: "Work item X is currently claimed by [session]"
2. Check timestamp - if >4 hours old, offer to reclaim
3. Suggest alternative available work items
4. Wait for user decision before proceeding
```

### üìä Plan Management Protocol
**When updating plan status:**
```
1. Mark work items as complete w/ ‚úÖ status indicator
2. **4 COMPLETED work items**: Move 2 "COMPLETED WORK" section w/ summary format
3. **4 ACTIVE/FUTURE work items**: PRESERVE all original details & conceptual info
4. **Completed work summary format**: "‚úÖ [Item]: [Files modified] - [Brief outcome summary]"
5. **Never compress active or planned work items** - maintain all specifications & req
6. Only apply compaction 2 work that is 100% finished & validated
```

üö® **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**:
- **Completed work**: Can be summarized 4 token efficiency while preserving outcome history
- **Active/Future work**: Must retain 100% of original detail, specifications, & conceptual info
- This command enhances plans by adding parallel execution capabilities while preserving all planning detail 4 incomplete work

## Success Criteria

A well-orchestrated plan should:
- ‚úÖ Enable 3+ assistants to work simultaneously without file conflicts
