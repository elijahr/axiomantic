# /axi-implement - Complete Dev Workflow

*Doc is compressed: std abbrev, txtspeak shortcuts, emoji 4 concepts, & omitted articles/pronouns where context clear.*

Execute complete dev workflow w/ plan integration, TDD approach, & systematic debugging 4: **$ARGUMENTS**

> **ðŸ’¡ Best Results**: Always discover & analyze existing plans before starting impl 2 ensure coordinated dev.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES

**Plan-First Dev**: Never start implementing w/o identifying plan & work item 2 ensure progress tracking & coordination.

**Systematic Debugging**: When issues arise, use 6-step scientific debugging methodology rather than trial-&-err approaches.

**Quality Gates**: Apply Five-Pillar Valid8n before marking any work item comp - no exceptions.

## Dev Workflow ðŸ”„

### Phase 1: Plan Discovery & Work Item Selection

**Step 1: Plan Doc Discovery (Priority Order)**
1. `ROADMAP.md` - Major feats & multi-phase projs
2. `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Proj-specific planning docs
3. `README.md` (Roadmap sect) - Proj-level planning
4. `TODO.md` - Task lists & quick items
5. `.tmp/*.md` - Temp planning docs

**Step 2: Plan Resolution**
- **Multiple plans found** â†’ Present list, ask user which 2 follow
- **No plans found** â†’ Ask: "No existing plan found. Would you like 2 cr8 proj plan first?"
  - If yes â†’ Jump 2 `/axi-feat` workflow 4 comprehensive planning
  - If no â†’ Ask user 2 describe work & cr8 minimal spec

**Step 3: Work Item Selection**
- Parse selected plan doc 4 all work items
- Filter 4 unblocked items (no incomplete dependencies)
- Present avail opts: "Avail work items: [list]. Which would you like 2 work on?"
- If item claimed by another session â†’ Offer 2 take over or select diff item

### Phase 2: Work Item Analysis & Validation Planning

**Step 4: Work Item Analysis**
- **Scope**: What exactly needs to be implemented?
- **Files involved**: Which files will be created/modified?
- **Dependencies**: What existing code does this rely on?
- **Success criteria**: How will we know it's complete?
- **Testing approach**: Unit tests, integration tests, or both?

**Step 5: Proactive Validation Planning**
**Five-Pillar Pre-Planning:**
1. **Coding Standards**: Survey existing code patterns, naming conventions, error handling
2. **Documentation**: Plan docstrings, comments, README updates during implementation
3. **Project Patterns**: Identify existing patterns to follow (imports, file structure, etc.)
4. **Testing**: Design test strategy that achieves meaningful coverage and validation
5. **Instruction Quality**: If modifying commands/agents, follow process-oriented standards

**Active Rules Integration:**
- Load and apply user overrides (`.axiomantic/user-overrides.md`)
- Load and apply project overrides (`.axiomantic/project-overrides.md`)
- Note any rule conflicts and resolve according to precedence (User > Project > Base)
- Plan implementation approach that follows active rule set

**Step 6: Test-First Development Decision**
**Use TDD for**: New functions, API endpoints, business logic, data transformations
**Skip TDD for**: UI styling, configuration changes, documentation, simple file operations

**If using TDD:**
1. Write failing tests that would pass when feature is complete
2. Follow testing standards from `/axi-test` and active rules
3. Run tests to confirm they fail (red phase)
4. Begin implementation to make tests pass

### Phase 3: Implementation with Continuous Validation

**Step 7: Implementation Cycle**
1. **Pre-Implementation**: Review active rules and validation criteria before coding
2. **Implement**: Write code following identified patterns and active rules
3. **Continuous Validation**: Apply Five-Pillar checks during development, not after
4. **Test**: Run tests and observe results with meaningful assertions
5. **Debug**: If failures occur, apply 6-step debugging methodology
6. **Iterate**: Repeat until tests pass and requirements met
7. **Final Validation**: Confirm Five-Pillar compliance before marking complete

**Continuous Five-Pillar Application:**
- **During Coding**: Follow discovered patterns, apply naming conventions, handle errors consistently
- **During Documentation**: Write docstrings and comments that match project style
- **During Testing**: Create tests that validate behavior meaningfully and achieve coverage goals
- **Before Commits**: Self-validate against all five pillars to catch issues early

## 6-Step Scientific Debugging Methodology

When encountering failures, test errors, or unexpected behavior:

### 1. Reproduce Systematically
- Create minimal, consistent reproduction case
- Document exact steps, inputs, and environment conditions
- Verify issue occurs repeatedly under same conditions
- Isolate variables - change one thing at a time

### 2. Gather Evidence & Context
- Collect all relevant logs, error messages, and stack traces
- Document environment details (versions, configurations, state)
- Capture exact input data and expected vs. actual outputs
- Use debugging tools to inspect runtime state

### 3. Form Scientific Hypotheses
- Generate 2-3 specific hypotheses about root cause based on evidence
- Make hypotheses testable and falsifiable
- Consider multiple potential causes, don't fixate on first guess
- Question assumptions - "What am I assuming that might be wrong?"

### 4. Test Hypotheses Methodically
- Design specific tests for each hypothesis
- Test one hypothesis at a time with controlled changes
- Document what you test and results (even negative results)
- Use scientific method - isolate variables and observe

### 5. Identify Root Cause, Not Symptoms
- Look beyond immediate symptoms to underlying system causes
- Ask "Why?" iteratively - each answer leads to deeper "why?"
- Consider component interactions, timing issues, state dependencies
- Distinguish between triggers and root causes

### 6. Fix Comprehensively & Validate
- Address root cause, not just surface symptoms
- Test fix thoroughly - solves problem without breaking other parts?
- Consider broader impact on other system components
- Update tests, documentation, error handling to prevent recurrence

## Work Item Completion Process

### Completion Validation Checklist
Before marking work item complete:
1. **Functionality** â†’ All acceptance criteria met? âœ…
2. **Testing** â†’ Tests pass with adequate coverage? âœ…
3. **Code Quality** â†’ Follows project coding standards? âœ…
4. **Documentation** â†’ Code properly documented? âœ…
5. **Integration** â†’ Works correctly with existing codebase? âœ…
6. **No Regressions** â†’ Existing functionality still works? âœ…

### Plan Status Updates
- Update plan document with work item completion
- Mark dependencies as satisfied for dependent items
- Update progress indicators and milestone tracking
- If using orchestrated plan â†’ Release file locks, update coordination status

### Commit & Documentation
- Create meaningful commit with conventional format
- Include work item reference in commit message
- Update relevant documentation
- Note discovered issues or technical debt for future consideration

## Integration with Other Commands

### Plan Management
- Use `/axi-plan` for orchestrated multi-assistant plans
- Handle plan conflicts and coordination automatically
- Update plan status as work items complete

### Quality Assurance
- Apply `/axi-validate` standards throughout development
- Use `/axi-test` systematic approach for test creation
- Ensure Five-Pillar Validation before completion

### Feature Development
- If work item requires architectural analysis â†’ Integrate with `/axi-feature`
- Apply integration planning for complex features
- Use codebase analysis capabilities when needed

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Development
- Adapt implementation approach based on project type and technologies
- Use project-specific patterns discovered through codebase analysis
- Apply appropriate testing strategies for technology stack
- Follow established architectural patterns

### Multi-Assistant Coordination
- Respect file ownership and coordination protocols when working on orchestrated plans
- Update global plan status appropriately
- Handle conflicts and blocking situations
- Communicate progress through plan document updates

### Continuous Quality Assurance
- Apply validation standards continuously, not just at completion
- Use systematic debugging for any issues encountered
- Maintain clean, readable code throughout process
- Document decisions and trade-offs made during implementation
