# Doc Stds
### Doc Stds
#### Doc Principles
- Write for your audience
- Keep doc close to code
- Update docs when code changes
- Use examples to clarify concepts
#### API Doc
- Doc all public interfaces
- Include param descs & types
- Provide usage examples
- Doc error conditions
#### Code Explanations
- Comment complex logic & algorithms
- Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Use clear, concise lang
- Avoid obvi comments
- Don't write comments about changes I ask you to make. Comment about the code as it exists, not the history of our session.
- Don't write comments unless they will be useful to a dev reading the code for the first time.
- Don't write "changelog" style comments (e.g., "added", "updated", "removed")
#### Communication & Clarity
- Use consistent terminology
- Structure info logically
- Provide context for decisions
- Make doc searchable
