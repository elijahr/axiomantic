# Docs Standards

### Docs Standards

#### Docs Principles

- Write for your audience
- Keep docs close to code
- Update docs when code changes
- Use examples to clarify concepts

#### API Docs

- Doc all public interfaces
- Include param descriptions & types
- Provide usage examples
- Doc error conditions

#### Code Explanations

- Comment complex logic & algorithms
- Explain "why" behind decisions
- Use clear, concise lang
- Avoid obvious comments
- _NEVER_ write comments about changes I ask you to make. Comment about code as it exists, not history of our session.
- _NEVER_ write comments unless they'll be useful to dev reading code for first time.
- _NEVER_ write "changelog" style comments (e.g., "added", "updated", "removed")

#### Communication & Clarity

- Use consistent terminology
- Structure info logically
- Provide context for decisions
- Make docs searchable
